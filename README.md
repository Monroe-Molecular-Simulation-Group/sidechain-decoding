Protein Sidechain Decoding
==============================

Code found here may be used to train models that decode from coarse-grained protein configurations (backbone atoms and a single coarse-grained bead per sidechain) to fully atomistic configurations.
This repository contains code used by and described in the below publication, where further methodological details may be found.
